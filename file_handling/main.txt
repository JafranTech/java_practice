To build this project with Spring Boot (Backend) and React (Frontend), you will need to download and install the following tools.

I have updated your 
Task List
 with this checklist.

1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
Required for: Running the Spring Boot backend.
Version: JDK 17 or JDK 21 (Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17+).
Download: Oracle JDK or OpenJDK (Eclipse Temurin).
Verify: Open your terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell) and run: java -version
2. Node.js
Required for: Running React and installing packages (npm).
Version: LTS (Long Term Support) version (e.g., v18 or v20).
Download: Node.js Official Website.
Verify: Run: node -v and npm -v
3. MySQL Server
Required for: The database to store all application data.
Download: MySQL Community Server.
GUI Tool: I strongly recommend installing MySQL Workbench (often included in the installer) to manage your database visually.
Alternative: You can use XAMPP or WAMP if you are comfortable with them, but a standalone MySQL install is cleaner for Spring Boot.
4. Code Editors (IDEs)
For Java (Backend): IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
Download IntelliJ - It has excellent support for Spring Boot even in the free version.
For React (Frontend): VS Code.
Download VS Code - The industry standard for web development.
5. Postman (Optional)
Required for: Testing your backend APIs (Login, Order Placement) before the frontend is ready.
Download Postman

Please install these tools if you haven't already.
